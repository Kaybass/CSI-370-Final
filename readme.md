# Computer Architecture Final Project

This project is a rewrite of an assignment I had is CSI-281 where I had to observe the speed of different sorting algorithms.

For this project I compared the speeds of four sorts written in C to the same sorts written in assembly using a program to output the results of the comparison.

Example Output:

Arrays were properly sorted and I lost the BubbleSort by 0.123783 seconds :o(

The times were 0.432669 seconds for my sort and 0.308886 seconds for the C sort


Arrays were properly sorted and I won the SelectionSort by 0.040738 seconds

The times were 0.061197 seconds for my sort and 0.101935 seconds for the C sort


Arrays were properly sorted and I won the QuickSort by 0.000214 seconds

The times were 0.000611 seconds for my sort and 0.000825 seconds for the C sort


Arrays were properly sorted and I won the InsertionSort by 0.033065 seconds

The times were 0.018219 seconds for my sort and 0.051284 seconds for the C sort
